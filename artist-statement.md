# Artist Statement

## What is the inspiration for your game?
When talking about simple games, I will remember the summer of my grade 6, when I played the game Snake on a Nokia phone for the whole summer with a friend, challenging ourselves for the high score. It is a simple and self-challenging game without AI, so it is not too hard to implement. I wanted to implement the game just in black and white, because the game I played only had two colours. However, I added a function to set obstacles on the map, and I thought it would be better to give different elements different colours in the game, so it looks like what it is now.

## How have you embraced the challenge of ?no existing code?, and how did it affect your design process in making this assignment?
I have never used existing code before, so it is not a big challenge for me. As for my design process, I think there should be three scenes first, and then use a variable "mode" to control the scenes, finally implement each scene.

## How have you tried to balance making it look beautiful with making it fun to play?
The algorithm of Snake is simple, so I designed the interface first. I set the basic elements - the snake and the background - in white and black to imitate the original game as well as easy to focus on. Later, I set the blocks and the game over text into brown and yellow, so that the colour range of the game is not too wide and easier for player to notice. To make it fun to play, I give every interaction reply when a player interacts with it. For example, when player moves the mouse on a button, an underline will appear, and when player clicks on it, there will be a sound. What's more, when the snake eats food, there will be another sound, and there is a background music all the time.

## How have you tried to engage the viewer/player in your game experience, and how do you keep them engaged?
I use energetic background music to attract and maintain my player?s interest. Since it is a game that many people have played, I may want to have a try. To keep them engaged, I have designed a map building function so that players can set obstacles to challenge themselves or make an interesting impediment to play with their friends. What's more, the high score will also keep them challenging each other.
